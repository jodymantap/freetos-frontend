Hi, everyone !

On this project, I build a simple React App named Freetos. Freetos stands for Free Photos, as it displays photos from Flickr API based on some categories. I use Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS to help me work on styles and interactions, and Axios to call the API from my Backend.

I have also done a unit testing on this, here's the link for that :
